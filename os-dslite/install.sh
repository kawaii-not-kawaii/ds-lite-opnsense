# OPNsense DS-Lite Plugin Installer
# Works over IPv6-only connections (for pre-tunnel install)
# Run this directly on the OPNsense box:
#   curl -6 -skL -o /tmp/install-dslite.sh "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kawaii-not-kawaii/ds-lite-opnsense/main/os-dslite/install.sh" && sh /tmp/install-dslite.sh
#
# Or offline, with no network at all: copy the whole os-dslite directory onto a
# USB stick, mount it on the box, and run install.sh from there. The script uses
# the src/ tree sitting next to it and never reaches for the network.
#   mount -t msdosfs /dev/da0s1 /mnt && sh /mnt/os-dslite/install.sh
#
# Set DSLITE_BUILD_ONLY=1 to build the package and stop without installing it.
# Use that to verify a USB stick on a working box before you rely on it at a
# site with no network.

# Files are fetched individually from raw.githubusercontent.com rather than as a
# tarball from github.com, because github.com and codeload.github.com are
# IPv4-only -- they publish no AAAA record. raw.githubusercontent.com is behind
# Fastly and does have real IPv6. Since the whole point of this installer is to
# run on a box whose IPv4 does not exist until the tunnel it installs is up,
# pulling the tarball would fail exactly when it is needed most.
