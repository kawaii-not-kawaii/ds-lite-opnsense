# DS-Lite tunnel teardown script
# Removes the gif tunnel interface and associated configuration.
#
# Every destructive step is gated on proof of ownership. This script runs from
# the configd "stop" action, which is also invoked by the package pre-deinstall
# hook, so it must be a no-op on a box where DS-Lite was never configured -- and
# it must never touch a default route or a gif interface belonging to something
# else.
